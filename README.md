# metadataeraser

Automates the use of mat2 with python, to work with the files in directory specify by the user; 
it erases all metadata of the files and generates a txt file with the information that was cleaned,
using 'exiftool'. Works only on linux and don't interact with direcoties insde other directories, yet...
